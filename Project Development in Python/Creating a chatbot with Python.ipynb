    "# Activity: Creating a chatbot with Python\n",
    "You are developing an AI-powered medical diagnosis assistant chatbot within a Jupyter Notebook environment. This chatbot will use spaCy to analyze user symptoms and provide preliminary diagnoses and recommendations, simulating a realistic medical interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will create the chatbot logic, define a knowledge base, and ensure the chatbot can effectively extract symptoms and provide appropriate advice, all within a Jupyter Notebook for automated assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for completing this lab\n",
    "As you navigate this lab, keep the following tips in mind:\n",
    "- `### YOUR CODE HERE ###` indicates where you should write code. Be sure to replace this with your own code before running the code cell.\n",
    "- You can save your work manually by clicking File and then Save in the menu bar at the top of the notebook.\n",
    "- You can download your work locally by clicking File and then Download and then specifying your preferred file format in the menu bar at the top of the notebook."

For example, you could assign higher weights to more severe symptoms or create rules to identify specific combinations of symptoms that indicate particular conditions.\n",
    " - **Contextual awareness:** Enhance the chatbot's ability to understand and utilize the context of the conversation to provide more relevant responses.\n",
    " - **User-specific information:** Incorporate user details like age, gender, and medical history to personalize the diagnosis and recommendations. For example, you could avoid suggesting \"menstrual cramps\" as a possible condition for a male user.\n",
    " - **Error handling:** Improve the chatbot's robustness by adding more comprehensive error handling for various scenarios, such as invalid input or missing data.\n",
    " - **External knowledge bases:** Explore integrating more extensive medical knowledge bases or ontologies to provide a wider range of diagnoses and more detailed information.\n",
    " - **Ethical considerations:** Continue to refine the chatbot's responses to ensure they are responsible, ethical, and prioritize the user's well-being. Always emphasize the importance of consulting a medical professional for accurate diagnosis and treatment.\n",
